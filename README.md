## Rick and Morty World - React Project

This project was created with vite. It accesses the Rick and Morty API and retrieves character information from there. Axios was used for this. Styled-Components were used for styling. Component-based animations have also been added. There are Loading State and Error Handling controls. Error Handling seems more advanced with React-Toastify. Built according to Best React Practice.
